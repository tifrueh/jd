.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.P
The \fBjd-config\fR command is the preferred way to get, set and unset
configuration options of the \fBjd\fR utility. It is, of course, also possible
to set configuration options by editing the configuration file directly (see
\fIFILES\fR), but using \fBjd-config\fR is way less prone to errors, so it is
strongly recommended that you use it.
.P
If no arguments are specified, \fBjd-config\fR will simply list all
configuration options and their values, behaving essentially as if \fB--list\fR
were specified.
.P
It is also worth mentioning that \fBjd-config\fR will allow you to set any
configuration option, even if the \fBjd\fR utility doesn't do anything with it.
To see which configuration options are actually read and used by \fBjd\fR,
please refer to \fBjd.conf\fR(5).
.P
Note: Configuration option names can only contain up to 63 bytes. Configuration
values, on the other hand, can contain up to 255 bytes. Beware these limits,
especially if there are non-ASCII characters in either name or value, as
non-ASCII characters may take up more than one byte.
