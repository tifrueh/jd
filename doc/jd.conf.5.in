.TH JD.CONF 5 2024-08-22 "jd @tag@"
.
.SH NAME
.
jd.conf \- configuration file for the jd utility
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.P
The \fBjd\fP utility can be customised using this configuration file, located at
\fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jd/jd.conf\fP. It is, however, not recommended to edit this
file directly, as using \fBjd-conf\fP(1) is much less prone to errors.
.TP
If you really want to edit \fIjd.conf\fP directly, the syntax is as follows:
.IP
Each line shall contain first the name of a configuration option, followed by a
"=" and then by the value of said configuration option. Spaces are interpreted
as-is, which means that:
.IP
.EX
a=b
.EE
.IP
is not equivalent to:
.IP
.EX
a = b
.EE
.IP
Name and value may both contain any character (excluding '=' in case of the
name), as long as the size of the name does not exceed 63 bytes and the size of
the value does not exceed 255 bytes.
.P
Please note that any configuration option can be set, even if the \fBjd\fP
utility doesn't do anything with it. The configuration options actually read and
used by \fBjd\fP are listed under \fIOPTIONS\fP.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.B jd_path
The file system path to the johnny.decimal system.
.
.TP
.B show_hidden
Set to "true" to show hidden files when using \fBjd-ls\fP(1) or to "false" to
hide them.
.IP
Default: false
